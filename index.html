                        <p>Hey there! My name is Max and I am a fresh face on the development scene. I started self-teaching a few months into 2019 with technologies like HTML CSS and Javascript before enrolling in a bootcamp through the Trilogy extension at UCSD. Learning under Travis, John, and Clark, my cohort and I are rapidly expanding our familiarity with web development and I am eager to see what is still yet to come!</p>
                        <p>I was born and raised in the Boston area of Massachusettes but decided to move out to San Diego when I was just around 20 years old with a good friend of mine from high school named Zak. We rented a Penske truck, threw our stuff in the back, and drove across the country to find our way to the sunny beaches of California. I have been enjoying the delightfully mild weather here for over 12 years now and thoughts of regret for making that move have never entered my mind.</p>
                        <p>My interests are varied, ranging from sports like soccer, wrestling or even just hiking to more indoor activities like video games, watching a good show or movie, and occasionally cooking with my wife Lydia. I have been married for several years now and we are happily expecting our first born by the end of 2019!</p>
                        <p>Thanks for checking out my site and I hope you enjoy your time here. Feel free to hit me up with a message via the contact page or head over to my portfolio to see what I have worked on so far along my travels towards becoming a competant coder/developer.</p>
